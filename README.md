# 📘 C Programming Language

### 🔹 What is C?

C is a **general-purpose, high-performance, low-level programming language** developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It’s considered the foundation for modern programming because many languages (like C++, Java, and Python) are influenced by it.

### 🔹 Where is C Used?

- Operating Systems (Linux, parts of Windows)
- Embedded Systems (IoT devices, microcontrollers)
- Compilers and Interpreters
- Database Systems (MySQL)
- System Software (Drivers, Utilities)

### 🔹 Key Features:

- 🏗️ **Structured Programming**
- ⚡ **High Speed and Performance**
- 🔒 **Direct Memory Access via Pointers**
- 🔄 **Portability**
- 🔍 **Small and Simple Keywords (only 32 keywords)**
- 🏆 **Powerful yet Minimalistic**

### 🔹 Advantages:

- 🎯 Excellent for low-level system programming
- 📚 Strong standard library (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, etc.)
- 🧩 Modular & Reusable Code with Functions

### 🔹 Disadvantages:

- ⚠️ Manual Memory Management (`malloc`, `free`)
- ❌ No direct Object-Oriented Programming
- 🔧 More coding required for simple tasks compared to high-level languages
